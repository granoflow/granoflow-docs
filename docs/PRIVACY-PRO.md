# 📜 Privacy Policy for GranoFlow Pro

**Last updated: November 2025**

## 1. Introduction

GranoFlow Pro (the “App”) is a paid version of GranoFlow, personally maintained by **William (Individual Developer)**.

In addition to local-first usage, GranoFlow Pro provides **optional account-based features**, including cloud synchronization and cross-device access.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. The App follows a **privacy-first, minimal-collection, and encryption-by-design** approach.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Account Information

When you register and sign in, we may collect the following **basic account information**:

* Email address
* Nickname or display name
* Profile avatar (optional)
* Authentication identifiers provided by third-party login providers (such as Google, Apple, or Microsoft)

We **do not request or collect additional personal profile data**, as the App does not require it.

---

### 2.2 User Content (Encrypted)

GranoFlow Pro allows you to synchronize certain app data to our servers, including:

* Fields and values
* Projects
* Milestones
* Tasks

**All such content is encrypted locally on your device before being uploaded.**

We **cannot read, access, or interpret** the plaintext contents of your synchronized data.

---

### 2.3 Local Data

All app data is stored locally on your device by default.

Cloud synchronization is **optional** and only enabled after you sign in.

---

### 2.4 Optional Diagnostics

If you consent, the App may collect **anonymous crash logs or diagnostic data** (for example, via Firebase Crashlytics).

This data is used **solely to improve stability and performance** and does **not contain personally identifiable information**.

You may disable diagnostics at any time via system settings.

---

### 2.5 Research Participation (Optional)

From time to time, we may invite users to participate in **voluntary research or product studies**.

Participation is **entirely optional**.

If a study requires additional data collection or specific conditions, a **separate research notice or supplementary terms** will be provided before participation.

No research participation will occur without your explicit consent.

## 3. How We Use Information

We use collected information only to:

* Provide account-based features such as authentication and synchronization
* Enable secure, encrypted cloud backup and multi-device access
* Maintain and improve App stability and functionality
* Respond to user feedback and support requests
* Conduct voluntary research with explicit user consent

---

## 4. Data Storage and Security

* User content synchronized to the cloud is **encrypted before upload**
* Servers store **encrypted data only**
* We do not maintain access to encryption keys that would allow us to read user content
* Account metadata is stored securely and separately from encrypted user content
* Reasonable technical and organizational measures are used to protect all stored data

---

## 5. Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties.

Data may be disclosed only:

* When required by law
