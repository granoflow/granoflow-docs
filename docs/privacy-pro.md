## 1. Scope of Application

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and protect information in connection with your use of GranoFlow Pro.

This Policy does **not** apply to third-party websites, services, or content.
If you access third-party services through the App, their respective privacy policies apply independently.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Account Information (If Applicable)

When you register for and sign in to GranoFlow Pro, we may collect the following basic account information:

* Email address
* Display name or nickname
* Profile avatar (if you choose to provide one)
* Authentication identifiers provided by third-party login services (such as user IDs or tokens from Google, Apple, or Microsoft)

We do **not** request or collect personal profile information unrelated to the core functionality of the App.

---

### 2.2 User Content (Locally Encrypted Before Synchronization)

With your explicit consent, GranoFlow Pro may synchronize certain application data to our servers, including but not limited to:

* Fields and values
* Projects
* Milestones
* Tasks

All such content is **encrypted locally on your device before upload**.
We cannot read, access, interpret, or analyze the plaintext content of your data, and we do **not** hold encryption keys capable of decrypting user content.

---

### 2.3 Local Data

By default, all application data is stored locally on your device.
Cloud synchronization is **optional** and only enabled after you sign in and explicitly activate it.

---

### 2.4 Optional Diagnostic Information

With your explicit consent, the App may collect anonymous crash logs or diagnostic data (for example, via Firebase Crashlytics).

Such data is used solely to improve application stability and performance and does **not** contain information that identifies you personally.
You may disable diagnostic data collection at any time via system settings.

---

### 2.5 Research and Study Participation (Optional)

From time to time, we may invite users to participate in voluntary research or product studies.

* Participation is entirely voluntary
* Non-participation does not affect access to any App features
* Research data is collected and used only with your explicit consent

If a study involves additional data scope, purposes, or conditions, a separate research notice or supplementary terms will be provided in advance.

For privacy protection, research data is identified using an independent **research ID**, which is **not linked** to your account identity.

---

## 3. How We Use Information

We use collected information solely for the following purposes:

* Providing account login, authentication, and security-related functionality
* Enabling encrypted cloud synchronization and cross-device access
* Maintaining and improving App stability and functionality
* Responding to user feedback and support requests
* Conducting research or studies with explicit user consent

---

## 4. Data Storage and Security

We employ reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including but not limited to:

* Local encryption of user content prior to upload
* Server-side storage of encrypted data only
* Separation of encrypted content from account metadata
* No possession of encryption keys capable of decrypting user content

While we take reasonable security measures, no network or storage system can guarantee absolute security.

---

## 5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do **not** sell, rent, or otherwise provide personal data to third parties.

Data may be disclosed or processed only in the following circumstances:

* When required by applicable laws or lawful governmental requests
* With your explicit consent
* To essential service providers strictly necessary for operating the App (such as authentication or infrastructure services), subject to confidentiality obligations and limited to the minimum required scope

---

## 6. Email Communications

In the course of providing the App, we may send you **necessary service-related emails**, including but not limited to:

* Registration, login, or authentication notices
* Account security or abnormal activity alerts
* Notifications related to data processing, data cleanup, or account status
* Notices of material changes to the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy

Such emails are sent solely for service fulfillment, security, and legal compliance purposes and **do not constitute marketing, promotional, or subscription content**.

We will not send marketing or newsletter emails unless you explicitly opt in.

---

## 7. Your Rights

You have the right to:

* Access, update, or correct your account information
* Disable cloud synchronization at any time
* Delete your account, which removes server-stored data
* Uninstall the App to remove locally stored data
* Withdraw consent for diagnostic data collection or research participation at any time

---

## 8. Information Related to Minors

GranoFlow Pro is **not specifically designed for or targeted at children under the age of 13**.

Due to the App’s encryption-first architecture, user content is encrypted locally before synchronization. As a result, we cannot identify, parse, or determine whether user content relates to minors, nor do we analyze user content to infer user identity or age.

We recognize that minors may require psychological support in certain contexts; however, GranoFlow Pro functions solely as a **personal management and reflection tool** and does **not** constitute psychological treatment, psychological intervention, or professional advice of any kind.

If, through legal requirements, user disclosure, or other reasonable means, we become explicitly aware of personal information relating to a user under the age of 13, we will take appropriate actions in accordance with applicable laws.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.

If changes materially affect your rights, we will notify you through the App or via email.
