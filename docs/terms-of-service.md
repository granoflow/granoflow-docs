Welcome to Granoflow (“the App”, “we”, or “us”).
Please read these Terms of Service (“Terms”) carefully before using the App.
By accessing, downloading, registering for, or using Granoflow, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

## 1. Nature of the Service

Granoflow is a personal task, project, goal, and life management application designed to help users record, plan, and reflect on their activities.

The App is provided solely as a **personal management tool** and **does not constitute**:

* medical advice;
* psychological therapy or counseling; or
* professional advice or guaranteed outcomes of any kind.

Any decisions made based on the use of the App, and any consequences arising therefrom, are solely the responsibility of the user.

## 2. Service Provision

Granoflow is provided on an **“as is”** basis.

We may update, modify, or adjust the App’s features, interface, or service methods from time to time without prior notice.
While we will take reasonable measures to maintain service stability where feasible, **we do not guarantee uninterrupted availability, error-free operation, or permanent continuity of the service**.

Certain features of the App may rely on **third-party services** (such as authentication, messaging, or infrastructure services).
The availability and stability of such features may be affected by the performance of those third-party service providers.

## 3. Accounts and Authentication (If Applicable)

### 3.1 Account Creation

Some features of the App may require account registration through third-party authentication providers (such as Google, Apple, or Microsoft).

### 3.2 Account Security

You are responsible for safeguarding your login credentials and for all activities conducted under your account.
If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account, please contact us promptly.

## 4. User Content and Data Rights

### 4.1 Ownership of User Content

All content created, entered, or uploaded by you in the App (including but not limited to text, tasks, projects, and attachments) remains your property.

### 4.2 License to Use

For the purpose of operating and providing the App, you grant us a **limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license** to use such content solely as necessary to deliver the relevant services.

## 5. Free Features and Paid Services

### 5.1 Free Features

Free users may access basic features of Granoflow.
Free features are primarily local-only and **do not include cloud synchronization, server storage, or other services that require ongoing network resources**.

We make no guarantees regarding the continued availability or retention of data associated with free features.

### 5.2 Paid Services and Subscriptions

Granoflow may offer paid features or subscription plans, including but not limited to monthly, annual, and lifetime access options.

* **Lifetime access** refers to the right to use the purchased features **for the duration of the App’s normal operation**;
* Lifetime access **does not imply free or perpetual server resources or data storage**.

Certain services may require ongoing data maintenance or infrastructure costs.

### 5.3 Data Maintenance and Cleanup

If a user discontinues payment for services related to server resources for more than **90 days**,
we reserve the right to remove server-stored data (including, but not limited to, attachments or cloud content).

Such data removal **does not affect the user’s acquired feature usage rights**.
Users may resume use of their purchased features upon meeting the applicable conditions again.

## 6. Research and Study Participation (If Applicable)

We may occasionally invite users to participate in voluntary research or study activities.

* Participation is entirely voluntary;
* Declining participation will not affect access to the App’s core features or user rights;
* Research data will be handled in accordance with applicable privacy disclosures and will not be linked to user account identities.

Specific research arrangements will be explained separately at the time of invitation.

## 7. Notifications and Content Delivery

The App may send users service-related notifications, including but not limited to:

* application updates;
* service status notices;
* usage tips or links to publicly accessible third-party content (such as experience articles or community discussions).

Such notifications are provided **for informational purposes only** and **do not constitute advice, guidance, or professional opinions**, nor do they represent our views.

Users may disable such notifications through system settings.

In the course of providing Granoflow services, we may send you **necessary service-related emails**, including but not limited to:

* registration, login, or identity verification emails;
* account security or unusual activity alerts;
* notifications related to data processing, data cleanup, or account status;
* notices of material changes to these Terms or our Privacy Policy.

These emails are sent **solely for service fulfillment, security, and legal compliance purposes** and **do not constitute marketing or promotional communications**.

You may manage or disable non-essential communications through in-app settings or methods provided in the emails.
